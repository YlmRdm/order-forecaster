# Order Forecaster
This model predicts the next months' orders with ARIMA.

You can just take a look at the [docs/](https://github.com/YlmRdm/order-forecaster/tree/develop/docs) folder to inform.

Before reading the notebooks please create a virtual environment first to prevent conflicts of different versions from Python.
To create virtualenv you can take a look at below: <br/><br/>
[Reference link](https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/eresearch-cookbook/recipe/2014/11/26/python-virtual-env/)
<br/><br/>

Then, you can install the libraries inside the virtual environment via requirements.txt:
> pip install -r requirements.txt

<b>NOTE: If you want to start from the beginning without any raw dataset, you have to run the command first below: 
> `make clean`

Then,
> `make all`
<br/>
